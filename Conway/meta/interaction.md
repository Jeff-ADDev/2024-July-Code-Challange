## Prompt

You are a Python developer who has been challenged to produce the most robust solution with the most up-to-date libraries and coding practices to solve a single problem.  

Overview of the problem: Conway’s Game of Life is a cellular automaton created in 1970 by British mathematician John Horton Conway. It’s a zero-player game whose evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game consists of a grid of cells that can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The state of each cell evolves in discrete time steps according to a simple set of rules based on the state of its eight neighbors.
Here are the basic rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
The game begins with an initial configuration of live and dead cells. As the rules are applied repeatedly, patterns emerge, evolve, and sometimes stabilize or disappear. Some patterns can become quite complex and exhibit behaviors similar to those found in natural systems.  

Specifics of the problem: Step 1: Solve the LeetCode problem.
Step 2: Expand your LeetCode solution by accepting an initial grid state, applying the rules of Conway’s Game of Life, and outputting the grid state for multiple generations.
Step 3 (Optional): Create a graphical representation to visualize and animate its evolution.

#### Step 1: LeetCode Solution
``` python
def gameOfLife(board):
    m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
    directions = [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1)]
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            live_neighbors = 0
            for d in directions:
                ni, nj = i + d[0], j + d[1]
                if 0 <= ni < m and 0 <= nj < n and abs(board[ni][nj]) == 1:
                    live_neighbors += 1
            if board[i][j] == 1 and (live_neighbors < 2 or live_neighbors > 3):
                board[i][j] = -1
            if board[i][j] == 0 and live_neighbors == 3:
                board[i][j] = 2
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if board[i][j] == -1:
                board[i][j] = 0
            elif board[i][j] == 2:
                board[i][j] = 1
    return board
```

#### Step 2: Expanded Solution
``` python
def conway_game_of_life(initial_state, generations):
    board = [row[:] for row in initial_state]
    for _ in range(generations):
        board = gameOfLife(board)
    return board
```

#### Step 3 (Optional): Graphical Representation
``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation

def animate_game_of_life(initial_state, generations):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.set_axis_off()
    board = [row[:] for row in initial_state]
    im = ax.imshow(board, cmap='binary')

    def update(frame):
        global board
        board = gameOfLife(board)
        im.set_array(board)
        return im,

    ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=generations, blit=True)
    plt.show()
```

#### Example Usage
```
initial_state = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

animate_game_of_life(initial_state, 10)
```

### Result
- Just one library to install
- Running without visualization produced no output
- Running with visualization produced an error

### Response
The error message is indicating that the variable board is not defined in the update function. This is because the board variable is defined in the animate_game_of_life function and is not accessible in the update function.
To fix this, you can make board a global variable by adding global board to the update function. However, using global variables is generally discouraged.
A better solution is to create a class to encapsulate the game of life and its state. Here's an example:

This way, the board variable is an instance variable and is accessible in both the gameOfLife and animate methods.
