## Prompt
```
You are a Python developer who has been challenged to produce the most robust solution with the most up-to-date libraries and coding practices to solve a single problem.  

Overview of the problem: Conway’s Game of Life is a cellular automaton created in 1970 by British mathematician John Horton Conway. It’s a zero-player game whose evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game consists of a grid of cells that can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The state of each cell evolves in discrete time steps according to a simple set of rules based on the state of its eight neighbors.
Here are the basic rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
The game begins with an initial configuration of live and dead cells. As the rules are applied repeatedly, patterns emerge, evolve, and sometimes stabilize or disappear. Some patterns can become quite complex and exhibit behaviors similar to those found in natural systems.  

Specifics of the problem: Step 1: Solve the LeetCode problem.
Step 2: Expand your LeetCode solution by accepting an initial grid state, applying the rules of Conway’s Game of Life, and outputting the grid state for multiple generations.
Step 3 (Optional): Create a graphical representation to visualize and animate its evolution.
```

### Response

Let's break down the steps and implement a robust solution for Conway's Game of Life in Python.

Step 1: Solve the LeetCode Problem
LeetCode provides a simplified version of Conway's Game of Life where you need to update the grid in place. Here’s how you can solve it:

LeetCode Problem Solution

Step 2: Expand the Solution to Multiple Generations
We will create a function that takes an initial grid and a number of generations, applies the rules of Conway's Game of Life, and returns the grid state after the given number of generations.

Step 3: Create a Graphical Representation (Optional)
For graphical representation, we can use the matplotlib library to create an animation of the board's evolution.

Graphical Representation

This code animates the evolution of Conway's Game of Life using matplotlib. It updates the board in each frame and displays the changes.

Summary
We started with the basic LeetCode problem and solved it.
We extended the solution to handle multiple generations.
We provided an optional graphical representation using matplotlib for visualizing the evolution of the game.
These steps cover solving the problem robustly using up-to-date Python practices and libraries.

#### Graphical Solution
``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation
import numpy as np

def animate_game_of_life(initial_board: List[List[int]], generations: int):
    board = np.array(initial_board)
    
    def update(frame):
        nonlocal board
        new_board = np.copy(board)
        for row in range(board.shape[0]):
            for col in range(board.shape[1]):
                live_neighbors = np.sum(board[max(0, row-1):min(board.shape[0], row+2), max(0, col-1):min(board.shape[1], col+2)]) - board[row, col]
                if board[row, col] == 1 and (live_neighbors < 2 or live_neighbors > 3):
                    new_board[row, col] = 0
                elif board[row, col] == 0 and live_neighbors == 3:
                    new_board[row, col] = 1
        mat.set_data(new_board)
        board = new_board
        return [mat]
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    mat = ax.matshow(board, cmap='binary')
    
    ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=generations, interval=200, blit=True)
    plt.show()

# Example usage:
initial_board = [
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0]
]

generations = 10
animate_game_of_life(initial_board, generations)

```


### Result
- Non graphical only shows one generation
- Graphical works well
